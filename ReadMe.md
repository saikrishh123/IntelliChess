# IntelliChess
Chess is an amazing game and over the years, thanks to the advances in computer technology, the game has produced some magical silent battles. However,  the teaching mechanisms are still mostly traditional and there is a large scope for improvement when it comes to using technology. This is particularly more evident at the beginner levels, where it is hard to understand the computer generated moves. This project is aimed to bridge this gap by analyzing the game at a more deeper level through various metrics, visualizations and automated tools while simultaneously having fun in the process. 


# Getting Started

The project is still in initial phase and will be soon exported to Pypi once a stable build is reached.
For now to access the tools please use the following command to clone the repository. 


    git clone https://github.com/saikrishh123/IntelliChess

The project depends on multiple python packages and the list is presented in the requirements.txt file. To install the packages using pip use the following command

    cd IntelliChess
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
 
 # AutoPlay with chess servers
 
 To autoplay with chess engines run the file play_chess.py. As of now an intial manual calibration to detect the squares is needed. In future versions, an automatic board detection will be added. Following is a screenshot playing with chess.com computer level 8 using stockfish engine in the loop.
